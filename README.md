CSV File Comparator
The CSV File Comparator is a Python script that allows you to compare two CSV files and create a new CSV file with the matching and non-matching rows. The script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to select the input CSV files, the output CSV file, and the columns to match on.

Getting Started
To use the CSV File Comparator, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python 3 installed, you can download the CSV File Comparator script from this repository.

Alternatively you can use the compare4.exe to run the script without the need for installing Python. 

Usage
To use the CSV File Comparator, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the CSV File Comparator script.

Run the script by typing the following command:

python csv_file_comparator.py

The GUI will open. Use the "Browse" buttons to select the first CSV file, the second CSV file, and the output CSV file.

Use the "Select the column or columns to match on" button to select the columns to match on. You can select multiple columns by holding down the "Ctrl" key while clicking on the column names.

Click the "Compare CSV Files" button to compare the CSV files and create the new CSV file.

Once the script has finished running, a message box will appear to let you know that the new CSV file has been created.
